      "Tomatoes are 95 percent water, with most varieties soaking up summer rains to become pump and juicy on the vine. Water, along with sunshine and nutrient-rich soil, is needed at every stage of the growing process. Otherwise, tomatoes won't grow, blossom and produce fruit. ",

      "Tomatoes need warmth to ripen. The warmer a tomato is, the quicker it will ripen. Putting your tomatoes in the fridge is therefore no help to them at all, and can even degrade their texture to 'mealy'. ",
